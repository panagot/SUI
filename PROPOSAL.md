## Long Term Plan

### Sustainability Strategy

#### 1. **Open Source Community**
- Open source on GitHub under MIT license
- Encourage community contributions via clear CONTRIBUTING.md
- Accept PRs for new features, bug fixes, and improvements
- Build a community of contributors passionate about Sui tooling

#### 2. **Continuous Maintenance** (6 months commitment)
- Monthly dependency updates
- Bug fixes within 72 hours of report
- Quarterly feature additions based on community feedback
- Stay updated with Sui SDK changes and new transaction types

#### 3. **Infrastructure**
- Host on Vercel free tier (sufficient for MVP)
- Use public Sui RPC endpoints (no ongoing costs)
- Domain costs: ~$12/year (if custom domain desired)
- **Estimated ongoing cost**: $0-50/year

#### 4. **Feature Roadmap**
- **Month 1-2**: MVP launch, gather user feedback
- **Month 3-4**: Add advanced visualizations, export features
- **Month 5-6**: Multi-network support, performance optimizations

- GitHub Sponsors for support
- Grants for major new features

#### 7. **Succession Plan**
If primary maintainer becomes unavailable:
- Document handoff process in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Transfer repo to Sui Foundation or trusted community member
- All code well-documented for easy pickup
- Core architecture simple enough for community maintenance

### Commitment
I commit to maintaining this project for **at least 6 months post-deployment** with regular updates, bug fixes, and community engagement. The open-source nature ensures the project can continue even beyond my involvement.

- **Improves transparency** of on-chain actions
- **Enhances debugging** for developers
- **Builds trust** by making transactions understandable
- **Strengthens ecosystem** with valuable developer tooling

### Unique Value
Unlike explorers that show raw data, this tool:
- Translates transactions into natural language
- Focuses on user understanding, not just data display
- Provides educational context for learning Sui
- Offers a template for other Sui tools to build upon
